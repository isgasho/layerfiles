# What do Layerfiles do?

Layerfiles are a format for quickly building, starting, and stopping VMs.

They're particularly useful for local developer environments and running acceptance tests.

When you build a Layerfile, it automatically takes snapshots along the way and re-uses those the next time you need to build it.

Layerfiles are based on Dockerfiles, so they should be immediately familiar to anyone that's used Docker.
